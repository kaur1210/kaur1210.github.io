<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Harshpreet kaur and I lived with my joint family in a small city in India called 
    mohali . I was born on 31<sup>st</sup>december,2003. </p>
 <p><strong>My Acadamic Background:</strong> Having completed my schooling in a local school, I had the opportunity to explore my passion for the arts. During the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to pursue a diploma in fine arts in Chandigarh. This decision was made during my 11<sup>th</sup>grade, and I successfully completed the program amidst the uncertainties brought about by the global health crisis. Throughout my studies in fine arts, I discovered a deep appreciation and fascination for the world of arts and media. Recognizing the potential for growth and personal development in this field, I sought the advice of friends who suggested that Algonquin College would be an excellent institution to pursue my chosen program  </p>
<p><strong>My Other Interest:</strong> While my primary focus and passion lie within the field of media, I have a diverse range of interests that contribute to my overall personal and creative development. Among these hobbies, I am particularly fond of traveling, singing, painting, and reading. However, it is painting that holds a special place in my heart, as it has become my favorite pastime and a source of great joy and self-expression. Over the years, I have dedicated a significant amount of time to honing my skills as a painter. I have explored various artistic techniques and experimented with different mediums, including both traditional and contemporary styles. Whether it be a blank canvas or other surfaces, I find immense pleasure in bringing my artistic visions to life through the stroke of a brush and the blend of vibrant colors.</p>
